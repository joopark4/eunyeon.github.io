Welcome to the example project page! Here is how you can document your work.

## 1. Embedding Images
You can easily embed images using Markdown syntax. Just place them in the `assets/images/` folder.

## 2. Embedding YouTube Videos
To show a demo video without using up GitHub's storage limits, you can embed a YouTube video right into your page.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## 3. Providing Download Links
For your private projects, you can provide a direct link to download the release (executable, zip file, etc.). 

If the file is **under 100MB**, you can upload it to your repository's `/assets/downloads/` folder.
If it's larger, we recommend linking to a Google Drive or S3 bucket.

<a href="/assets/downloads/sample-release-v1.0.zip" class="btn btn-success" download>📥 Download Release v1.0 (Sample)</a>
</center>

## Conclusion 
This is just a starting point. Feel free to edit this file in the `_posts/` folder to add your actual projects!
